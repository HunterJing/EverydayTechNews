# EverydayTechNews
Automatically sending tech news to your email every morning.

## Original Intention behind Creation

When I was young, the elders in my family used to subscribe to newspapers. However, with the advent of technology, newspapers gradually faded from our view, replaced by the overwhelming flood of internet news.

In this vast ocean of information, there is an abundance of content, often chaotic and diverse. Yet, in reality, I am only interested in a limited range of topics.

That's why I created this tool, which automatically sends me tech news to my email every day.

By doing so, I no longer get overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information. Instead, it allows me to focus on the specific areas of interest, just like reading the sections I found most fascinating in the newspaper.

这个小工具是基于python开发的，主函数在根目录下的main.py文件中
